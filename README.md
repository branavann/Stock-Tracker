# Stock-Tracker

## Project Goal

This project deploys a series of python packages to provide stock-related information to users. The intention behind this project was to create a web-facing application using streamlit. The interface is intended to provide quick and accessible information to user. The project was built primarily around my financial needs (e.g. accessing basic information pertaining to a stock).

This project require numerous attempts to troubleshoot and accurately display information. The ability to display options-related information was a massive incentive for this project. This required hours to explore the yfinance package to gain a comprehensive understanding and employ it in an effective manner. 

This is the first of many finance-related package. Please feel free to provide any feedback. I'm open to any and all suggestions.

**Packages**:
- yfinance
- streamlit
- pandas
- plotly
